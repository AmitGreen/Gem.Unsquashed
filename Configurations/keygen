How to generate a key:

    Here we generate a key for `first.last`

    It will create two files:
        ~/.ssh/first.last (private key)
        ~/.ssh/first.last.pub (public key)

    You need to enter three things:

        1. cd ~/.ssh
        2. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 7777 -C first.last@gmail.com
        3. first.last

    Here is a copy of the three command, intermixed with ssh-keygen output:

        1.  cd ~/.ssh
        2.  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 7777 -C first.last@gmail.com
        3.  Generating public/private rsa key pair.
            Enter file in which to save the key (/home/joy/.ssh/id_rsa): first.last
            Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
            Enter same passphrase again:
            Your identification has been saved in first.last.
            Your public key has been saved in first.last.pub.
            The key fingerprint is:
            SHA256:P8wRaBMltMX1GWf/JmSHXpl1gRXyyFL4clLdbKlLIAc first.last@gmail.com

    Upload the 'first.last.pub' file to your gitlab or github

Next you need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file

    Host gem
        HostName github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/first.last

You can now test it as follows:

    ssh -T gem
